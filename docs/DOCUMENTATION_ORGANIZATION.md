# Documentation Organization Complete ✅

The `docs/` folder has been organized into a clean, topic-based structure for better navigation and maintainability.

## 📂 New Structure

### Overview
```
docs/
├── README.md                  # Main documentation index
├── QUICK_REFERENCE.md         # Fast access to common tasks
│
├── 🔐 security/              # Authentication & Authorization (14 files)
├── 🔌 graphql/               # GraphQL API (8 files)
├── 🏗️ architecture/          # System Architecture (2 files)
├── 🗄️ mongodb/               # Database (2 files)
└── 📦 typescript/            # Frontend Components (2 files)
```
